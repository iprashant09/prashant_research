### üë®‚Äçüî¨ About Me

I am a dedicated researcher with a Ph.D. in Electronics Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi. My primary research focuses on the fabrication and characterization of eco-friendly, solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and metal oxide-based thin-film transistors (TFTs). I am passionate about developing low-voltage operable electronic devices, gas sensors, and phototransistors using novel materials and large-area suitable fabrication techniques like the floating film transfer method.
